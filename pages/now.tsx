          Before studying CS, I used to want to become a doctor and studyed
          Biomedical Engineering while gunning med admissions. CS and Medicine
          overlap in that you can help people - just in different ways. For
          example, working in health tech to improve patient outcomes.

        <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm leading-[1.5rem] pt-4 max-w-[500px]">
          I&apos;m trying to find the shape of what that career would look like
          while keeping my options open.

          I just finished a web app that shows people what you've been listening
          to recently on Spotify! I had to get deep into Next.js, React and
          JS/TS to do it. Next I&apos;m planning on doing something with data
          visualisation or real-time collaboration, or learning more C / Go.
          There&apos;re heaps of cool things being developed on the web, and I'm
          keen to get stuck into trying some new things!

          I've been exploring Sydney more recently, which makes me very happy.
          The past two years have made me appreciate small moments, like basking
          in the glow of a sunset and taking in the smell of nature, more.
          Here's to more moments like that this year!
