Around a year ago, I started learning how to code from scratch and built my [first side project](https://mixtape.jyao.me/). Today, I'm a front-end engineer at [Relevance AI](https://tryrelevance.com), the world's leading analysis and visualization platform for unstructured data.

Reflecting upon my journey, it's been wild, fortunate and I'm truly grateful - in hopes of helping people embarking upon their quest to become a software engineer, here's what I think helped me get here.

# Build things

Experience trumps all and building things is what got me noticed - from a [climate visualisation app](https://www.unihack.net/events/2022) that took out five awards and second place in an Australian-wide hackathon to a [learning platform](https://github.com/csesoc/learning-platform) for my university's Computer Science society. Instead of watching tutorial videos and attending lectures, I built things to learn, to scratch the itch to make beautiful things, and to make things I wanted. It helped tremendously when interviewing because I could cite specific experience and talk through the implementation details. **Build things for the sake of it and without following templates - the process of learning comes from banging your head against the wall at 2AM trying to get something to work.**

# Seek out opportunities

Stay incredibly curious and stay humble. Talk to people who interest you and ask lots of questions. [Earlywork](https://www.earlywork.co/) is a great resource if you're in Australia - it's how I landed my job at Relevance AI. Do hackathons with friends and seek out internships on LinkedIn and on Twitter. This mentality connected me with so many interesting people.

# Love what you do

A trend I've noticed is that many people switch into Computer Science for the money but end up disappointed when it's a lot of work. The field is already saturated with junior developers, so you need to stand out by punching above the pack. You can only do this by putting in effort or shining, and you can only do that if you love what you do. Sweat the details, from UX to implementation. Understand your unique advantage (https://drgurner.substack.com/p/obsess-over-the-right-things) and push it.

# Embrace serendipity

Say yes to things that come your way.

The best opportunities along the way ... twitter

Dive down the rabbit hole and say yes to things. (Winning hackathon, getting an internship).

# Break free from expectations

People think you have to complete a Computer Science degree and do XYZ to become a software engineer. And while it's true that the fundamentals help, I'd like to tell you that that's bullshit. (The only reason you'll get where you are is if you believe in yourself.) Empower yourself to seek out opportunities and build, and you will get noticed.
