Hi! I'm Jeffrey Yao, a first-year Computer Science student at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) and incoming Software Engineer intern at [Bukalapak's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukalapak) new Sydney engineering office this summer. In a previous life, I spent two years studying Mechanical / Biomedical Engineering before switching to the dark side. I'm passionate about optimisation, health-tech and augmented reality which I think may change the way we experience the world.

I'm driven by an eye for beautiful design, the desire to get to the bottom of a problem, and the urge to build something new. Good design is [reductive, aesthetic and thorough](https://www.vitsoe.com/rw/about/good-design) - in short, I sweat the small details.

If I'm not studying or building [personal projects](/projects), I'm either working out, cooking a new recipe, finding somewhere new to explore in Sydney, or [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/jefffdy?si=ad2ae55d28f04e70).
